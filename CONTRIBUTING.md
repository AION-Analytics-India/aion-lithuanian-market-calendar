# Contributing

Corrections to holiday data are the most valuable contribution this project can
receive, and they do not require writing any code.

## Reporting a wrong date

Open an issue with the year, the date, and what it should be. If you can point
at the Labour Code or another primary source, include it. Holiday rules are the
one thing in this package that must be right, and a native speaker noticing a
wrong name or a missing day is worth more than a refactor.

Three questions we would particularly like answered by someone in Lithuania:

1. Is the list of sixteen statutory non-working days complete?
2. Is Father's Day always the first Sunday of June?
3. When a holiday falls on a Saturday, is the following Monday given off, or is
   the day simply absorbed? This package currently assumes absorbed, and if that
   is wrong every business-day calculation is affected.

## Code changes

1. Fork and branch from `main`.
2. Add a test. Holiday logic without a test will not be merged.
3. Run the suite: `python -m pytest tests -q`
4. Keep to PEP 8, four spaces, type hints where they help.

Holidays are computed rather than stored in a table, deliberately: it is what
makes the package correct for any future year without maintenance. Please do not
replace the computation with a data file.
